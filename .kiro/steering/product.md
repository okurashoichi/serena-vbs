# Product Overview

Serena is a powerful **coding agent toolkit** that provides IDE-like semantic code retrieval and editing capabilities to LLMs. Unlike traditional file-based approaches (grep, cat, string replacement), Serena enables symbol-level code understanding and manipulation.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Semantic Code Navigation** - Find symbols, references, and relationships at the code structure level
2. **Symbol-level Editing** - Insert, replace, and modify code by symbol context rather than line numbers
3. **Multi-language LSP Integration** - Leverage Language Server Protocol for 30+ programming languages
4. **MCP Server** - Expose tools via Model Context Protocol for integration with LLM clients
5. **Project-based Workflow** - Configure language servers and project settings per-project

## Target Use Cases

- **Large Codebases** - Navigating complex, strongly-structured projects where file-based approaches fail
- **Code Refactoring** - Finding all references, understanding dependencies, making targeted edits
- **IDE-like Agent Workflows** - Enabling LLMs to work like seasoned developers using IDE capabilities
- **Multi-language Projects** - Supporting diverse tech stacks with unified tooling

## Value Proposition

- **Token Efficiency** - Retrieve only relevant code symbols instead of entire files
- **Accuracy** - Symbol-level understanding prevents incorrect edits from ambiguous text matching
- **Free & Open-Source** - No subscription fees, enhances existing LLM capabilities
- **Framework Agnostic** - Works with Claude, Codex, ChatGPT (via mcpo), and custom agents
